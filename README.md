# MATH3261-5285: Fluids, Oceans and Climate
Repository of learning materials for Fluids, Oceans and Climate, a course at UNSW.

This course aims to provide a solid foundation for the analysis of geophysical flows that arise in the study of the ocean, the atmosphere, and their interactions in the climate system. This course introduces the fundamental equations of motion and conservation laws that govern the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean. These equations are then systematically simplified and solved to quantitatively model key phenomena selected from the enormously rich variety of atmospheric and oceanic flows.

A key skill to be developed in this course is a physical understanding of fluid flows. Students will study and perform numerical experiments of simplified geophysical systems in order to see beyond the mathematical formalism and gain a robust understanding of the sometimes counter-intuitive behaviour of geophysical flows.

Currently this repostiory contains ipython notebook for a set of computer labs that will be held throughout the course. The labs can be completed online from any browser window using Google Colaboratory (Colab). These labs were first written by Dr Shane Keating with some later edits by Dr Jan Zika.
